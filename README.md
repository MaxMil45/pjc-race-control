Describe the thinking behind the design of this feature.  
The basic features of the app are:

. Start a race timer

. Record the finish time of each runner in that race

. Submit results to a server

. Clear race results from their device after the race

. Record race results on a phone that is in "airplane mode" - i.e. offline

. Store data from one race at a time.

. Provide timing for races up to 24 hours in length

. Upload race results to a server (either live during the race and/or as a batch upload afterwards if data is recorded in "airplane mode")

. Receive data from users

. Display race results

. Provide timely results (as data is uploaded or immediately after, so runners can see their official positions and times before they go home).

You may wish to group prompts into headings/sections - use markdown in any way that it helps you communicate your use of AI.  Tell us about what went right,  what went horribly wrong and what you learned from it.

>  how can I integrate QRST here?
The suggestion worked with minor modifications.
